# Machine Learning for Air Traffic Management
 Airsense (a division of Airbus - MÃ¼nchen) organized this 2 day ADS-B Hackathon at [Airbus Leadership University](https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2016/09/Airbus-Group-Opens-Leadership-University-In-Toulouse-.html), Toulouse on Oct 29 and Oct 30, 2018.  This repository is a collection of the various Machine Learning algorithms (such as LSTMs, MLPs and XGBoost) that I implemented for predicting various parameters related to _Air Traffic Control_ such as Flight Trajectory, ETA and Runway Classification.

### USER STORY - Runway and Holding Pattern Detection:
The participants had to pick a particular _user story_ (team) and I joined the following team:

- **Our Project Title:** Runway and Holding analysis - LHR arrivals case
- **My Task** : Detect holding patterns and do runway classification with flight arrivals data for LHR (London Heathrow) airport.
