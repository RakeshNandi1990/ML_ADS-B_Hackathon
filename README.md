# Machine Learning for Air Traffic Management
 [Airsense](https://news-hub.intra.corp/common/en/Pages/AirSense-Make-more-of-the-Sky.aspx) (a division within Airbus - München) organized this 2 day ADS-B Hackathon at [Airbus Leadership University](https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2016/09/Airbus-Group-Opens-Leadership-University-In-Toulouse-.html), Toulouse on Oct 29 and Oct 30, 2018.  This repository is a collection of the various Machine Learning algorithms (such as LSTMs, MLPs and XGBoost) that I implemented for predicting various parameters related to _Air Traffic Control_ such as Flight Trajectory, ETA and Runway Classification.

### USER STORY - Runway and Holding Pattern Detection:
The participants had to pick a particular _user story_ (team) and I joined the following team:

*  **Project Title:** [Runway and Holding analysis - LHR arrivals case](https://communities.intra.corp/sites/ads-b/ADSB%20Hackathon%202018/ADS-B%20Hackathon_Outcome_Team3.pdf)
* **Task** : Detect holding patterns and do runway classification with flight arrivals data for LHR (London Heathrow) airport.
